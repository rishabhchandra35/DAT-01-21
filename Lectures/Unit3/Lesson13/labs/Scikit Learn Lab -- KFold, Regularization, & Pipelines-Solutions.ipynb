    "\n",
    "Welcome!  This lab is going to introduce us to some very important aspects of data processing and model building.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, it's going to go over the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **KFold Cross Validation:** This is a more thorough way of choosing your validation set to give you a better idea of how your model might perform under various circumstances within your training data.\n",
    " - **Regularization:** This is an evergreen technique for dealing with models that are overfit (ie, higher scores on training vs. test data).  Regularized linear models are often much better prepared to handle messy data & outliers when using this technique.\n",
    " - **Pipelines:** (Time permitting!) This is an underappreciated aspect of the Scikit-Learn api that allows you to chain together multiple data processing steps, making it much easier to test different models and work seamlessly between your training & test sets."
