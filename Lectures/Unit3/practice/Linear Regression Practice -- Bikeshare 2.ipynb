    "Welcome!  This notebook is designed to provide additional practice for people looking to get more familiar with Linear Regression and SciKit Learn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of the notebook is using Linear Regression to forecast demand for bikeshare stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has the following columns:  \n",
    "\n",
    "  - **datetime:** a timestamp collected hourly.\n",
    "  - **season:** a categorical column that lists the current season for that observation\n",
    "  - **holiday:** a column (0 or 1), that detects whether or not it was a holiday\n",
    "  - **workingday:** a column (0 or 1), that encodes whether or not it was a workday or not\n",
    "  - **weather:** a categorical column that lists a light weather description for the observation\n",
    "  - **temp:** the temperature outside\n",
    "  - **atemp:** the temperature it feels like outside\n",
    "  - **humidity:** the humidity outside\n",
    "  - **windspeed:** the windspeed, in mph\n",
    "  - **count:** the number of bikes checked out during that hour\n",
    "  \n",
    "Your job is to build a regression model that appropriately captures the information available to make the most accurate predictions."

    " - you can create a column called `Daytime` that tests whether or not it's light outside.  (Ie, between 7PM - 7AM is `False`, `True` otherwise).  You could also get fancier and adjust the daylight hours depending on season.  \n",
    "\n",
    " - you can also create a variable that tracks the passage of time.  This can be done by finding the earliest date in the dataset, subtracting each observed date from that and extracting the datepart in days.  This way, if you have an upward or downward trend throughout the dataset, you'd be able to capture it. So something like `X_train['time'] = (X_train.index.hour - earliest_date).days \n",
    "\n",
    "You could also try multiplying different columns together.  Maybe it being `Daytime`, `Sunny` and low humidity has a multiplicative effect that isn't totally captured by any of the variables by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Dateparts, despite being numbers, are probably best encoded as **nominal** variables.....think about it -- the 11 AM hour is something distinct from the 11 PM hour.....they are best interpreted as being separate categories than one continuous column.  You should onehot encode them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2nd Note:** If you create a column that's `True/False` those should also be one-hot encoded."
