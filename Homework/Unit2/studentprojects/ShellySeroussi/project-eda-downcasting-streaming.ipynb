    "Most software used for handling data makes use of your available RAM to process its tasks.  If the size of your file neatly fits into the available RAM that your computer has then this is fine.  If it's significantly larger (no laptop is going to have 1TB of RAM for example), then you won't be able to load in the file and work with it.\n",

    "Numbers come in different flavors in pandas and numpy.  At the simplest level you have integers (whole numbers) and floating point numbers (numbers with decimals).  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, numbers use different sized containers to store their values.  They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **64 bit:** Can store values as large as 2<sup>64</sup>, which is 18446744073709551616\n",
    " - **32 bit:** Can store values as large as 2<sup>32</sup>, which is 4294967296\n",
    " - **16 bit:** Good for values up to 2<sup>16</sup>, 65536\n",
    " - **8 bit:**  2<sup>8</sup>, or up to 264\n",
    " \n",
    "**Integers** typically have the above range, while **floats** typically can only go down to 32 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the whole range of numeric data types here:  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The important detail here, is that if a number is encoded as being a 64 bit number, it will *always* use the same amount of memory to store it, even if the value itself is much smaller.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you have a column of 0's and 1's, an 8 bit encoding will work perfectly fine (since the values are less than 2<sup>8</sup>), and a 64 bit encoding will take up 8x as much memory as it needs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important detail about how Pandas works is that *all numbers are automatically encoded as 64 bit numbers*.  This is good for making sure values aren't tampered with, but bad for optimizing memory with large files.\n",

    " - `df.memory_usage()`, returns the memory usage, in bytes, of whatever is selected.\n",

The values in this dictionary will be used to fill missing values in the file at the location in `file_path_read`.\n",

    "The big idea behind this file is that you'll be able to do data cleaning operations on a file you've never actually seen in your terminal before.\n",

    "**Hint:** Pandas has a `to_csv()` method, with the option of appending lines to the end of it -- this is good to use when looping through the file stream.\n",

    "**Note:** We will check to see that column headers are not added multiple times!\n",
    "\n",
    "**To Test:** We will first call `probe_df` on the `taxi` dataset in its original location to get a dictionary with its missing values.  We will then use that value as a basis for the `missing_vals` argument in the `write_df` function, and use those to fill in its missing values.\n",
