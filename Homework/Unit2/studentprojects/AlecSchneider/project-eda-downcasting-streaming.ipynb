If it's significantly larger (no laptop is going to have 1TB of RAM for example), then you won't be able to load in the file and work with it.\n",

    "Numbers come in different flavors in pandas and numpy.  At the simplest level you have integers (whole numbers) and floating point numbers (numbers with decimals).  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, numbers use different sized containers to store their values.  They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **64 bit:** Can store values as large as 2<sup>64</sup>, which is 18446744073709551616\n",
    " - **32 bit:** Can store values as large as 2<sup>32</sup>, which is 4294967296\n",
    " - **16 bit:** Good for values up to 2<sup>16</sup>, 65536\n",
    " - **8 bit:**  2<sup>8</sup>, or up to 264\n",
    " \n",
    "**Integers** typically have the above range, while **floats** typically can only go down to 32 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the whole range of numeric data types here:  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The important detail here, is that if a number is encoded as being a 64 bit number, it will *always* use the same amount of memory to store it, even if the value itself is much smaller.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you have a column of 0's and 1's, an 8 bit encoding will work perfectly fine (since the values are less than 2<sup>8</sup>), and a 64 bit encoding will take up 8x as much memory as it needs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important detail about how Pandas works is that *all numbers are automatically encoded as 64 bit numbers*.  This is good for making sure values aren't tampered with, but bad for optimizing memory with large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods Used For Managing Memory In Pandas:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - `df.memory_usage()`, returns the memory usage, in bytes, of whatever is selected.\n",
    " - `pd.Series.astype()`, allows you to change the data type of 1 variable to another.\n",
    " - `df.info()`, returns the data type and memory usage of every column selected\n",

Often new columns are added to datasets in the middle of their collection, and all values for all times before that are simply `null`, so just reading in the first 5000 or 10000 might not give you a consistent picture of what to expect.\n",

    " - `file_path_read`   : str, required; location of file to read in.\n",
    " - `file_path_write`  : str, required; location of the file to write the new file out to\n",
    " - `chunksize`, int, required, default value is 1000.  Size of the chunk to use when streaming in the file.\n",
    " - `missing_vals`: dict, optional; accepts a dictionary as an argument with key/value pairs that list the column in the dataset(key) as well as the value to fill missing values with for that column(value).  The values in this dictionary will be used to fill missing values in the file at the location in `file_path_read`.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Returns:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function will **not** return a value in the terminal.  What it **will** do is write a new file to the location specified in `file_path_write`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example if you call `write_df('file/path/to/stream', 'file/path/to/write')`, a new file will appear in the location at `file/path/to/write` as the function is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big idea behind this file is that you'll be able to do data cleaning operations on a file you've never actually seen in your terminal before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Pandas has a `to_csv()` method, with the option of appending lines to the end of it -- this is good to use when looping through the file stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We will check to see that column headers are not added multiple times!\n",
    "\n",
    "**To Test:** We will first call `probe_df` on the `taxi` dataset in its original location to get a dictionary with its missing values.  We will then use that value as a basis for the `missing_vals` argument in the `write_df` function, and use those to fill in its missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both of these functions work as intended, they will allow us to fill in the dataset's missing values without having looked at it, and you will receive full marks."
