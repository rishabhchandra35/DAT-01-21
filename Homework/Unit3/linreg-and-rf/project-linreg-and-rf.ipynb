    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We've discussed overfitting in the context of bias and variance, and we've touched on some techniques, such as regularization, that are used to avoid overfitting (but haven't practiced them yet). In this lesson we'll discuss a fundamental method for avoiding overfitting that is commonly referred to as _train/test split_ validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is similar to something called \"cross-validation\" — in fact, it is a type of cross-validation — in that we split the data set into two subsets:\n",
    "* A subset on which to train our model.\n",
    "* A subset on which to test our model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This serves two useful purposes:\n",
    "* We prevent overfitting by not using all of the data.\n",
    "* We have some remaining data we can use to evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this may seem like a relatively simple idea, **there are some caveats** to putting it into practice. For example, if you are not careful, it is easy to take a non-random split. Suppose we have salary data on technical professionals that is composed of 80 percent data from California and 20 percent data from elsewhere and is sorted by state. If we split our data into 80 percent training data and 20 percent testing data, we might inadvertantly select all the California data to train and all the non-California data to test. In this case we've still overfit on our data set because we did not sufficiently randomize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a situation like this we can use _k-fold cross-validation_, which is the same idea applied to more than two subsets. In particular, we partition our data into $k$ subsets and train on $k-1$ one of them, holding the last slice for testing. We can do this for each of the possible $k-1$ subsets."

    "# Independent Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately we use a test-training split to compare multiple models on the same data set. This could be comparisons of two linear models or of completely different models on the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your independent practice, fit three different models on the Boston housing data. For example, you could pick three different subsets of variables, one or more polynomial models, or any other model you'd like. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's What We Will Be Doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Working with Boston housing data to predict the value of a home\n",
    "* Create a test-train split of the data.\n",
    "* Train each of your models on the training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate each of the models on the test data.\n",
    "* Rank the models by how well they score on the testing data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Then, try k-folds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try a few different splits of data for the same models.\n",
    "* Perform a k-fold cross-validation and use the cross-validation scores to compare your models. Did this change your rankings?\n",
